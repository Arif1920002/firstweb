      Tree-planting is the process of transplanting tree seedlings, generally
      for forestry, land reclamation, or landscaping purpose. It differs from
      the transplantation of larger trees in arboriculture, and from the lower
      cost but slower and less reliable distribution of tree seeds. Trees
      contribute to their environment over long periods of time by providing
      oxygen, improving air quality, climate amelioration, conserving water,
      preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. During the process of
      photosynthesis, trees take in carbon dioxide and produce the oxygen we
      breathe.
      <br /><br />
      In silviculture the activity is known as reforestation, or afforestation,
      depending on whether the area being planted has or has not recently been
      forested. It involves planting seedlings over an area of land where the
      forest has been harvested or damaged by fire, disease or human activity.
      Tree planting is carried out in many different parts of the world, and
      strategies may differ widely across nations and regions and among
      individual reforestation companies. Tree planting is grounded in forest
      science, and if performed properly can result in the successful
      regeneration of a deforested area. Reforestation is the commercial logging
      industry's answer to the large-scale destruction of old growth forests,
      but a planted forest rarely replicates the biodiversity and complexity of
      a natural forest.
      <br /><br />
      Because trees remove carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, tree
      planting can be used as a geoengineering technique to remove CO2 from the
      atmosphere. Desert greening projects are also motivated by improved
      biodiversity and reclamation of natural water systems, but also improved
      economic and social welfare due to an increased number of jobs in farming
      and forestry.
